# 🌊 Ganga River Water Quality Forecasting System

## Overview 🌍
The **Ganga River Water Quality Forecasting System** aims to provide **real-time monitoring** and **forecasting** of water quality in the Ganga River. Using **AI-enabled Decision Support Systems (DSS)**, **satellite data**, **IoT sensors**, and **dynamic models**, the system forecasts water quality conditions to support sustainable river management decisions.

## Features 🛠️
- **Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring** 📊: Uses **IoT sensors** to measure water quality parameters like pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and more.
- **Satellite Data Integration** 🛰️: Combines **satellite imagery** (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) for comprehensive analysis of the river’s water quality.
- **AI-Driven Forecasting** 🤖: **Machine learning models** predict water quality in real-time, enabling proactive actions.
- **Interactive Dashboard** 📈: Visual representation of water quality data and forecasts for decision-making.
- **Dynamic Models** 🌊: Simulates future conditions based on current data to forecast water quality.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (MERN Stack)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Satellite Data**: Remote sensing (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel)
- **IoT**: Water quality sensors (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen)
- **Modeling**: Hydrological and water quality models
